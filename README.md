# VDH Services Calculator

Calculates eligibility levels for the VA Department of Health, which are based on **Federal Poverty Level**. Federal Poverty level is calculated using income and household sizes.

This application turns [this reference sheet](reference-sheet.jpg) into a small application that makes the same calculations.
